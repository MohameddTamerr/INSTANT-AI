# DAY 10
### (1)Kind Of Software Testing:
1)<ins>Functional Testing(What System Should Do?)</ins>:evaluate functions that the system should perform functional requirments may be discribed  in work products  such as business requirment.

2)<ins>Non-Functional Testing(How Will System Behaves?) </ins>:evaluate characteristics of systems and software such as usabilty performance efficiency or security.

3)<ins>White-Box Testing</ins>: is an approach that allows testers to inspect and verify the inner workings of a software systemâ€”its code, infrastructure, and integrations with external systems. White box testing is an essential part of automated build processes in a modern Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) development pipeline.

4)<ins>Black-Box Testing</ins>:involves testing a system with no prior knowledge of its internal workings. A tester provides an input, and observes the output generated by the system under test. This makes it possible to identify how the system responds to expected and unexpected user actions, its response time, usability issues and reliability issues.

### (2)Diffrence Between Unit Testing And System Testing:

| Unit Testing           | System Testing  |
|:-------------:| -----:|
| In unit testing, independent software module are tested separately. |System testing is done to check whether the software or product meets the specified requirements or not. |
| Unit testing is performed by the developers.      |System testing is generally done by developers and testers. |
| Unit testing is also called white box testing.    |System testing is also called black box testing. |
|Unit testing generally focuses on functional verification.   |System testing generally focuses on system validation.  |
|Unit testing comprise of independent modules.  | System Testing comprise of System and integration testing.|
|Unit testing follows the specification of modules.|System testing follows the requirements specification.|
|It gives high performance because of single module testing at a time.|It gives relatively low performance than unit testing.|
|Error finding is easy.|Error finding is difficult as compared to unit testing.|
|Resource requirement is less.|It is expensive.|
|Maintenance is relatively less expensive.|	Maintenance is expensive.|
|Unit tests are typically run on a small data set.|System tests are typically run on a large data set.|

### (4)Whats V-Model And How It works?:
The V model is a development protocol that places an emphasis on developing and implementing testing procedures throughout the developmental process. The model relies on a sequential approach beginning with larger goals, then progressing on to the systems and ultimately individual components which comprise the project. Each phase pairs with a corresponding test that allows developers to perform mid-development assessments of the functionality of a project, allowing for earlier challenge identification to save time and resources.

the project manager includes the main tasks and features their team needs to work on throughout the project life cycle to meet all the customer's requirements. The V model is similar to the waterfall model, which organizes these steps in a sequential life cycle. While the waterfall method uses a linear fashion to list each task, the V model uses a V-shaped graph.
On the left side of the V-shaped graph, the project manager includes details for each of the verification phases. These phases illustrate what the customer's requirements are and how the team plans to achieve them. The right side of the V represents the validation phases. This includes the specific tests the team must perform to validate whether the software meets all the customer's requirements.

### (6)Diffrence between design pattern and architecture pattern:
Design patterns - solves reoccurring problems in software construction

Architectural patterns - fundamental structural organization for software systems
