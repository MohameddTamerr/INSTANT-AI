### Unstructured Database

Unstructured data is information that is not arranged according to a preset data model or schema,
and therefore cannot be stored in a traditional relational database or RDBMS. Text and multimedia are two common
types of unstructured content. Many business documents are unstructured, as are email messages, videos, photos,
webpages, and audio files. Some examples of unstructured data include scientific data such as oil and gas 
surveys, space exploration, seismic imagery, and atmospheric data; digital surveillance such as reconnaissance
photos and videos; satellite imagery such as weather data, land forms, and military movements

### Cron Jobs Examples And How It Works:
Cron jobs are used to schedule tasks on a periodic basis. For example, 
you may have a cron job that runs every day to carry out a data backup, archive old files,
or have a cron job that runs every day at 7:30 PM that emails reports to your clients. Cron jobs are defined
in a file called the crontab. This file is unique to each user and while they’re usually located under /var/spool/cron/crontabs,
they’re not intended to be edited directly. Instead, you edit them through the crontab command: crontab -e2.

Here are some examples of cron jobs that can improve business efficiency:

Email Reminders

Database Backups

Archiving Old Data

Monitoring And Alerting

Data Analytics Or Reporting

Running Inventory Scripts

Syncing Files Between Systems

Checking For Software Updates.
You can set up a cron job to run database backups – and restore them. You can also use 
cron jobs to archive old data and free up space on your server. Cron jobs can be used
for monitoring and alerting purposes as well. You can also use cron jobs for data analytics
or reporting purposes. Running inventory scripts is another example of how you can use 
cron jobs to improve business efficiency. You can also use cron jobs for syncing files
between systems. Finally, you can use cron jobs for checking for software updates.

### Diffrence Between pip And conda:
pip and conda are both package managers for Python.
|pip|conda|
|:--:|:---:|
|pip is the Python Packaging Authority’s recommended tool for installing packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI). It installs Python software packaged as wheels or source distributions. The latter may require that the system have compatible compilers, and possibly libraries, installed before invoking pip to succeed|conda is a cross-platform package and environment manager that installs and manages conda packages from the Anaconda repository as well as from the Anaconda Cloud. Conda packages are binaries. There is never a need to have compilers available to install them. Additionally, conda packages are not limited to Python software. They may also contain C or C++ libraries, R packages or any other software|

### XML
XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. It is a markup language and file format for storing, transmitting, and reconstructing arbitrary data. 
It defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
Unlike HTML, which has predefined tags to use, XML allows you to define your own tags designed specifically for your needs. This is a powerful way to 
store data in a format that can be stored, searched, and shared.
XML also plays an important role in many different IT systems and is often used for distributing data over the Internet. There are many languages based on XML,
such as XHTML, MathML, SVG, RSS, and RDF. You can also define your own XML-based languages.
