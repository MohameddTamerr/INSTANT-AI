### Space Complexity BFS VS DFS:
<ins>DFS:</ins> uses a stack to store the nodes that are not yet explored. The stack can grow up to the maximum depth of the graph, which is O (n) in the worst case.
Therefore, the space complexity of DFS is O (n) in the worst case

<ins>BFS:</isn> uses a queue to store the nodes that are not yet explored. The queue can grow up to the maximum width of the graph, which
is O (n) in the worst case

### What's Compostion:
omposition in OOP is a way of creating complex classes by combining simpler classes or objects. 
It is based on the principle that classes should achieve polymorphic behavior and code reuse by their composition rather than inheritance1.
Composition allows for a has-a relationship between objects, where one object contains one or more references to other objects as its fields
